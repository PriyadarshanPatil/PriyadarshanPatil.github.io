          <p align="justify">Hi! I am Priyadarshan (PD). Welcome to my website. I am a doctoral candidate in the Operations Research and Industrial Engineering program at The University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on transportation network optimization in the realm of operations research. I am also interested in and work with engineering education research. In my spare time, I enjoy travelling, playing racquetball at a competetive level, kayaking, social dancing, photography, and creating memorable experiences. The rest of this website will give you a glimpse into my academic and non-academic life. My research interests lie in Network flow theory and optimization, algorithms, and data sciences.</p>
            <p align="justify">My Academic background is in Civil and architectural engineering, with a Bachelors degree from IIT Madras and a Masters degree from The University of Texas at Austin. In 2014, I joined the research group of Dr. Karthik K Srinivasan at IIT Madras and worked on network algorithms for sustainability and emission minimizations, quantifying their impact on the Chennai road network. In Fall 2015, I joined the research group of Dr. Chandra Bhat at UT Austin. I worked on transportation of OS/OW wind turbine components across Texas for TxDOT and computational performance comparison of algorithms for evaluation of Multivariate normal cumulative probability functions. Work for both projects has been published and citations are available in my CV.</p> 
			<blockquote>In Fall 2017, I started my journey as a doctoral student in the department of Operations research and Industrial engineering (ORIE) with Dr. Stephen Boyles.</blockquote>
			<p align="justify">My doctoral work consists of theroetical proofs of convergence for symmetric traffic assignment algorithms, analyzing effects of origin-destination matrix errors onto traffic assignment outputs, convergence criteria analysis of traffic assignment algorithms, and application of traffic assignment problem structure to the railroad electrification problem for the North American network.</p>
			<p align="justify">In addition to my primary doctoral research, I have assisted other researchers with their work. Two examples include research on post-disaster bridge reconstruction scheduling problem, where we propose a bidirectional search heuristic with customized pruning and branching strategies that exploit specific properties of traffic assignment sub-problem; and a decomposition heuristic for megaregional traffic assignment generating approximate solutions used for warm-starting other algorithms and saving computation time. My traffic engineering skills were used to assist the City of West Lake Hills as a consultant for an intersection redesign study focusing on traffic counts, resident survey, traffic simulation, and town hall presentations.</blockquote>
			<p align="justify">Academics aside, I am an avid traveller, having travelled to 26 countries so far. The highlights of my trips include midnight sun in Norway and jumping in freezing seas in the Lofoten islands, walking to the India-Pakistan border through an active landmine field, trans-US rail trip spanning Washington DC - NY - Chicago - LA - Austin, kayaking around coastal grottos in Portugal, and many others. 2019 brought me the opportunity to experience the northern lights in Abisko, Sweden. After all, as St. Augustine said - </p>
            <blockquote>“The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.”</blockquote>
            <p align="justify">My future plans include advancing the boundary of Transportation engineering and optimization knowledge and leaving my mark on the field in the form of meaningful research. I would like to keep learning and exploring new areas of knowledge and build up on old areas. I want to travel the world one day, and experience as much as I can. The future belongs to those who are willing to work and negotiate for their dreams, and I certainly plan to do so.</p>
