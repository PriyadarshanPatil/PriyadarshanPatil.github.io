    <h3>Why travel solo?</h3>

    <p align="justify" class="story1">I have often been asked about various aspects of my solo travels. The most common question I receive from friends and family is "Why travel solo?". It is a question that has flummoxed a lot of folks, especially from a society as social as India. What could possibly drive me and thousands of others every year to pack our bags, pick a destination, and be on our merry way without adding others to our plans? It is not an easy question to answer, but this post is an attempt to better understand the psyche of those to choose this path in their bid to experience the world.</p>
    <p align="justify" class="story1">First, let us get the obvious reasons out of the way. Travelling solo is logistically easy. No need to match schedules, no need to find common days off, no need to compromise on the itinerary you wish to have. Unless you are extremely lucky and have found one or more companions who have extremely similar interests and tolerances, there will be times when you will have to give up some items from your dream itinerary in order to accommodate your companions. These kinds of issues may include everything from destinations (too hot/too cold/too remote) to food choices (strictly vegetarian/unwilling to try out different cuisines) to entertainment (clubbing/partying/hiking/road trips) and so much more. Again, let me reiterate that these travel companions are not wrong in any way, they have their preferences and deserve to travel and explore while having those preferences respected. Travelling solo removes this compromise completely, leaving the traveler free to pursue his/her preferences. There far is too much of the world to see and too little time for us to be waiting on someone to see the world together. There is a negative stigma associated with enjoying activities alone, such as dining out or going to the movies, or travel. If one enjoys their own company, there is absolutely nothing wrong with doing any of it alone.</p>
    <p align="justify" class="story1">Every person has been shaped by their life experiences, which leaves them with a set of likes and dislikes. Some love and adore museums and wish to explore it. But according to the fellow traveler from Eritrea who I met in Oslo, he was uninterested in European museums because they represented the story told by the colonizers of his country. He was not interested in the story of how his people were killed and enslaved, he was more interested in meeting other people today and learning about their life today, leaving the past behind. Similarly, a lot of people love clubbing and partying. It is their release and a venue to let loose and have fun. I do not care for it, I’d rather be in bed early, trying to catch the next sunrise. While these are just a couple of examples, they serve as examples of a larger phenomenon at play. Knowing very well what I enjoy, I would prefer not to put myself in situations I do not enjoy for the sake of my travel companions. </p>
    <p align="justify" class="story1">The previous point in no way implies that one shouldn’t try new things at all or stay within their comfort zone. On the contrary, exploring outside your comfort zone acquaints one with their likes and dislikes as well as expands that comfort zone. Solo travel helps one dictate the pace at which they go beyond their comfort zone, while inevitably forcing one to step outside the comfort zone. Contrast solo travel with the opposite end of the spectrum, organized tours. The tour operators decide what you see, what food (usually your home cuisine) you eat, where you travel, what you shop, and how much you spend. This is the epitome of staying within the comfort zone. Solo travel requires the traveler to figure out everything from visa to bus tickets to food, while deciding their level of immersion in the local culture and mingling with locals. Everything from routine bookings to avoiding scams and finding local eateries, the traveler is responsible for, and thus ends up learning more about the destination.</p>
    <p align="justify" class="story1">Tying in with this, solo travel facilitates connection with like minded individuals as well as provides opportunities to learn from different cultures. Travelling with a companion or multiple companions reduces that likelihood as it is an instinct to stick with your pack and not mingle as freely. Every time I have travelled with friends/family, I have not interacted with other folks or locals much, preferring to stick with my group. On the contrary, travelling solo has led to me talking to a variety of people from around the globe with diverse backgrounds, all following their unique life paths. Whether it be the conversations about theology with a Swiss girl who was an electrician and working at the church in the Lauterbrunnen valley, or the falconer from California living in an Irish castle for work, or the kindergarten teachers visiting a town for a Pokémon tournament, or the 50-something French environmental researcher travelling to Abisko alone to experience the northern lights for the first time, it’s all a glimpse into the diversity of things going on around us. And while hobbies are the best way to meet people who enjoy things that you do, what’s the best way to meet people who love travelling? Solo travelling.</p>
    <p align="justify" class="story1">This is an endeavor which boosts confidence and improves engagement with yourself and the present moment. After all, the other distractions have been removed. It is just you, a stranger in a strange land, out to experience everything it offers and slowly transform into someone no longer a stranger. There is no room for hesitation. Just go with the flow. A plan does not work out? That’s absolutely fine, switch to something else. Meet someone interesting? Join their plan. Could not see a destination the way you wanted? Change your plan to potentially stay longer and visit it the way you wanted, or just visit it again. Solo travel allows you to focus more on the destination and yourself, immersing you in the present. It requires significant spatial awareness, quick thinking, decisive action and as mentioned, confidence, but rewards you with a sense of calm and fulfillment. The best way to experience different cultures is by immersion, and solo travel encourages it.</p>
    <p align="justify" class="story1">Is solo travel for everyone? Absolutely not. Does solo travel require a higher level of effort and planning? Potentially, but for experienced travelers, it requires nothing more than booking a flight and getting a visa. The rest can be figured out on the go. Does it change your life? Not dramatically, but in subtle ways. For example, I am happy living out of a carry-on backpack for a month-long trip and have met travelers who have done multi-month trips the same way. What are some drawbacks? It can occasionally get lonely not having someone to share the moment in. Some activities are cheaper with shared costs. The occasional safety concerns. Travel fatigue on long trips. Is it still worth it? Absolutely.</p>
