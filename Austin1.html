          <br>
          <p class="lead12" align="justify">Hi! I am Priyadarshan! This page documents the story of my first few months in Austin. While my life has revolved around University quite a bit, by no means is that the dominating theme here. As all good stories start, let us start at the beginning. I arrived in Austin on August 7, on the back of a 30 hour journey across the globe. I had arrived, finally, to the promised land, the land of dreams, America!</p>
          <p align="justify">As my flight was flying low over Austin, about to land, I got first glimpses of the city that I was to call home for the next few months. Large open spaces, lots of greenery, large roads with few vehicles, and most noticeably, an abundance of pickup trucks. Upon landing, I was taken aside at Immigration for an extra baggage check, being an Indian student is apparently sufficient cause for this. With that out of the way, we were finally free to go, go and start our lives in Austin. I proceeded to a friends place, where I was going to live for the first few days, until my apartment was finalized. Traveling via a rental van for all our luggage, we passed through downtown, The Dirty 6th, and by the University of Texas. It was enchanting, different from how I had dreamt it up to be, but way better.</p>
          <center><img src="assets/img/Downtown.JPG" alt="Components" class="img-responsive imgBanner"></center>
          <p align="center">View of Austin from the top of UT Tower!</p><br>
          <p align="justify">The next morning, I set out to explore the University with Kanchan, a fellow grad student. Having absolutely no idea how anything worked, both of us had to figure out simple things like how to pay for the bus ticket, how to cross the road (Jaywalking is illegal here), and find our way around town. We completed formalities like bank accounts, ID cards, visiting her apartment, and just roaming around campus. All this was slightly complicated by the fact that I did not have a smartphone, or internet, so traveling around with no connectivity was a lot of fun. The campus was deserted, due to the holidays, so it was waiting just for us, in all its pristine beauty. Here are some pictures of the campus, for you to experience a part of the beauty I saw!</p>

          <p align="center">The Campus and its Historic buildings and statues!</p><br>
          <p align="justify">The first few days were a cocktail of new friends, classmates, different orientation ceremonies, formalities and figuring out my new life. Some introductions were routine, while others were due to writing down an address on a paper napkin for a girl, or due to someone completely forgetting who I was and mentioning me to myself. </p>
          <blockquote>“A Picture is worth a thousand words”</blockquote>
          <p align="justify">Keeping in with this theme, this story will rely more on pictures rather than words to convey what I want to say. Here are some photos of friends I made through the semester.</p>

          <p align="center">Some Indian Friends!</p> -->
          <p align="justify">So, back to the story! Many orientation sessions later, the final event was here. "Gone to Texas!" A two-hour extravaganza filled with performances by students and talks by the President, some faculty and some students, finally culminated with a band performance, a 50-foot flag of Texas and Tower lighting.</p>

          <p align="center">Gone to Texas, welcoming the Batch of 2019!</p>
          <p align="justify">The semester started slowly, with everything slowly settling into a routine. 9 hours of classes, Badminton twice a week, soccer twice a week, squash/racquetball twice a week as well(in the later part of the semester) and the occasional weekend party. Aside from the usual academics, I was also doing some consultant work for the City of West Lake hills. In terms of balance of personal growth and professional life, this has been a golden period in my life. Managing everything from bills and payments to cooking for yourself, I started by winging it, but now, I am reasonably adept at it all. Talking of food (you know me, food is the second most important thing in my attention span!), starting from the basics to cooking kebabs and butter chicken and cakes, this sem has been a roller coaster of food. Food helps people bond, so I hosted people for Indian food and they hosted me over for their cuisine. This being Texas, Barbecue is the norm for social events, and there is nothing better than BBQ anyway. This led to multiple BBQ parties, some Texan style, a couple Brazilian style. Some pictures below to show you the barbecue as well as my cooking!</p>

          <p align="justify">The university campus and the city of Austin both have been a major part of my life here and to talk about them, in short, they are weird. In fact, Austin'<!-- ' -->s unofficial motto is</p> <blockquote> Keep Austin Weird</blockquote><p align="justify">Anyone familiar with my antics in the last few years knows how much I value weirdness and appreciate the small creative things around me. And as a friend mentioned to me "You fit in Austin like a missing piece of a Puzzle" The artistic, small-town ambiance the entire city exudes is beyond belief. There is art everywhere, people are friendly, the food is delicious, entertainment limitless and opportunities galore! The weather is Sunny, windy and dry, perfect for me. Have a look at the city!</p>

          <p align="justify">While leaving IIT-M, I was a bit skeptical about another place matching the expectations created by the beautiful campus. But UT Austin not only matches those, but exceeds them. This is a campus full of life and creativity, history and innovation. Apart from academics, which most departments are in the top 20 in the world in their fields, the campus has so many activities going on at any given time. Just to prove the point, UT is the national Quidditch champion! But seriously, the squirrels, the turtles, the people, the greenery and the buildings themselves make the campus come alive and help you create so many fun experiences. Where else are you going to find people fighting with pillows and lightsabers just before finals? The sports infrastructure is phenomenal, with our Football stadium being the 10th largest in the world, considering all stadiums at all levels of play, seating over a hundred thousand people! Go Longhorns!</p>

          <p align="justify">Here in Austin, I met so many diverse people with so many talents. Everyone has an interesting story to tell, something I can learn from them. They are all sorts of people, from sport junkies, to stand-up comedians, to masterful orators and debaters. People whose nationalities I couldn't guess, to people who enjoy cooking and baking. This sem was a roller coaster of emotions and experiences, from joy and exhilaration to sadness and culture shock. But at the end of it, I'm grateful to have experienced it and come out of it so much better. Lastly, to conclude, I'<!-- ' -->d like to post a picture that perfectly fits Austin, in all its weirdness and creativity, and delivers a message I live by!</p>
